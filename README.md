<h1>Hi, I'm Kevin! </h1>
<h3>I am game programmer looking for a first experience opportunity in the gaming industry! I've always loved video games since I was a child and I am now fortunate to turn my passion into my career. Over the course of my education, I've learned a lot about programming and game engines. I've been able to create amazing games for academic or personal projects and I'm going to continue to learn and improve my skills as a programmer to make the best video games possible.</h3>
